YouTube channels I've been exploring during the Covid era!

# Engineering / science stuff

## Vincent Racaniello
- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyFgCoP4ovsHbt92vM4zN2A
- https://www.microbe.tv/

This guy is a prof. from Columbia. He does several biology-related podcasts, and most relevant these days is TWIV "This Week in Virology".  They talk about relevant papers in virology without dumbing it down, but in a way that is accessible. The microbe.tv URL gets you just the podcasts; the YouTube link gets you videocasts of same material along with his course lectures.
Of particular interest are the weekly Covid clinical  updates.
latest: COVID-19 clinical update #45 with Dr. Daniel Griffin


## Tech Ingredients

Not sure who this guy is, but he does all sorts of interesting projects in his home lab. He talks through everything in great detail. Extremely well done!

## Undecided with Matt Ferrell

Random engineering stuff. In one of his latest, he talks about his experience with the Tesla solar panels and power wall.

## Steve Mould

More interesting science demos. Again, very well explained. 

## Just Have a Think

Lots of excellent energy related content. 

## Plainly Difficult

This guy is fascinating! He details all sorts of industrial accidents, many having to do with nuclear energy. 

## PBS Space Time

Here is where to go if you want to learn about the universe:  from quantum theory to black hole physics, and everything inbetween is discussed.

## 3Blue1Brown
- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw

The oddest name for a channel I've seen. This guy is a mathmetician and goes deep into lots of topics. I don't understand much; I think it would help a lot to be able to see the annimation and notation!

## Mentour Pilot
- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwpHKudUkP5tNgmMdexB3ow

Ever wanted to know how to land a commercial aircraft, or how pilots deal with emergency situations? This guy is fascinating!
